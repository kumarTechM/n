#About Try-catch-finally with return statement
1)If finally block returns a value then try and catch blocks may or may not return a value.

2) If finally block does not return a value then both try and catch blocks must return a value.

3)If try-catch-finally blocks are returning a value according to above rules, 
then you should not keep any statements after finally block. Because they become unreachable and in Java, Unreachable code gives compile time error.

4)finally block overrides any return values from try and catch blocks.

5)finally block will be always executed even though try and catch blocks are returning the control.
